Floating restaurant
A floating restaurant is a vessel, usually a large steel barge, used as a restaurant on water. The Jumbo Kingdom at Aberdeen in Hong Kong is an example. Sometimes retired ships are given a second lease on life as floating restaurants. The former car ferry New York, built 1941, serves as DiMillo's in Portland, Maine. Another example is the Train ferry Lansdowne which served as a restaurant in Detroit. Plans for the Lansdowne to continue in this capacity on the Buffalo, New York waterfront came to naught and she was scrapped in the summer of 2008. A third example of a ship's hull converted for this purpose is Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant in Toronto, which was located on the MS Jadran, a former Yugoslvian ship but has since been closed and scrapled. The Normac, the first Captain John's restaurant, was moved to Port Dahousie as the floating cocktail lounge Big Kahuna and is now the Riverboat Mexican Grill.
