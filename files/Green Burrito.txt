Green Burrito
Green Burrito is an American fast-food restaurant chain run by CKE Restaurants, located mostly in the Western and Southwestern United States and serving fast-food Tex-Mex.
Originally, Green Burrito was an independent restaurant in Hawaiian Gardens, California. Ruben Rodriguez purchased it in 1980, and turned it into a chain, whose parent company Santa Barbara Restaurant Group was acquired by CKE in 2001.
CKE's policy has been to add Green Burrito dual-branding to many of their Carl's Jr. hamburger restaurants, thereby adding a Mexican menu. As of 2008, there were 300 co-branded Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. restaurants.
CKE later introduced the identical Red Burrito for its Hardee's chain, which primarily serves the Midwestern and Southern United States.
