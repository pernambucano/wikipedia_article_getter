KLG (restaurant chain)
KLG (Chinese: 卡啦雞 in Taiwan; referred to as Kuai Le Gee in Malaysia, meaning "Happy Chicken") was a fast food restaurant chain in Malaysia, Taiwan, and mainland China, which had several similarities with KFC. The lettering of KLG adopted the same font and colour as KFC. KLG's logo depicted a plump chicken wearing a bow tie.
In Malaysia, there were several outlets in Ipoh, Penang (near Farlim) and Langkawi Island.
KLG's menu was relatively similar to that of KFC's in that fried chicken, french fries, chicken burgers and soft drinks were available in both restaurant chains.
All KLG locations are now closed.
