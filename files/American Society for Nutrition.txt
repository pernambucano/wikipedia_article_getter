American Society for Nutrition
The American Society for Nutrition (ASN) is the principal United States society for professional researchers and practitioners in the field of nutrition, publishing three of the leading journals in the field. The Society is one of the constituent societies comprising the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
ASN’s newest journal, Advances in Nutrition, received a very competitive first-time impact factor for 2012: 3.245. This ranks 20th in the Nutrition & Dietetics category and places it in the top 16% of the 8,411 journals indexed by Thomson Reuters. ASN has published the first specific journal in the subject, The Journal of Nutrition, since 1928. The Journal of Nutrition’s impact factor increased to 4.196 in 2012, placing it in the top 10% of all journals indexed and fourth among primary research journals in the Nutrition & Dietetics category. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition was first published in 1952. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition continued to rank highly for its 2012 impact factor, placing first among primary research journals in the Nutrition & Dietetics category with an impact factor of 6.504.
ASN was founded in 1928 as the American Institute for Nutrition. In 2005, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences (formerly the American Institute for Nutrition) and the Society for International Nutrition merged to form ASN.
