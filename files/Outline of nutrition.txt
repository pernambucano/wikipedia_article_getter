Outline of nutrition
The following outline is provided as an overview of and a topical guide to nutrition:
Nutrition (also called nutrition science) studies the relationship between diet and states of health and disease. The scope of nutrition science ranges from malnutrition to optimal health. Many common symptoms and diseases can often be prevented or alleviated with better nutrition.
