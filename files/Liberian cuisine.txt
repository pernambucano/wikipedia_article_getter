Liberian cuisine
Liberian cuisine is centered on the consumption of rice, tropical fruits, vegetables, fish and fufu.


DietEdit
Rice is a staple of the Liberia diet. Other ingredients include cassava, fish, bananas, citrus fruit, plantains, coconut, okra and sweet potatoes. Heavy stews spiced with habanero and scotch bonnet chillies are popular and eaten with fufu.
Liberian cuisine has been influenced by contact, trade and colonization from the United States, especially foods from the American South (Southern food). Liberia also has a tradition of baking imported from the United States that is unique in West Africa.


BushmeatEdit
Bushmeat is widely eaten in Liberia, and is considered a delicacy. A 2004 public opinion survey found that bushmeat ranked second behind fish amongst Monrovians as a preferred source of protein. Of households where bushmeat was served, 80% of residents said they cooked it “once in a while,” while 13% cooked it once a week and 7% cooked bushmeat daily. The survey was conducted during the last civil war, and bushmeat consumption is now believed to be far higher.
Endangered species are hunted for human consumption in Liberia. Species hunted for food in Liberia include elephants, pygmy hippopotamus, chimpanzees, leopards, duikers, and various types of monkeys.
