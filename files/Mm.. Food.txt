Mm.. Food
Mm.. Food is the fifth studio album by British-American emcee/producer MF DOOM. His second full-length album released under the MF DOOM moniker, it was released on November 16, 2004 under Rhymesayers Entertainment.


Overview
MM.. FOOD is an anagram of MF DOOM. Throughout the album, DOOM employs many food-related samples, and many of his lyrical themes are based on food metaphors. It contains several songs which were recorded as early as 2002, some previously released on singles, and a track ("One Beer") previously released under the name Madvillain and released on another label earlier in the same year.
The original cover art was painted by Jason Jagel and designed by Jeff Jank. The paintings contain scenes of MF DOOM eating breakfast, mixing chemicals in a forest, and people tied to trees. A bonus disc entitled Mm..LeftOvers was released by Rhymesayers and Hiphopsite.com to promote the album. The album was re-released on 24 July 2007 on Rhymesayers Entertainment. The re-release comes with a bonus DVD, Tour Poster, and a chocolate-scented Mm.. Food sticker.
Many of the samples DOOM uses on this album are taken from vintage episodes of Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and Superman. An example of this extensive use of sampling can be found in the intro of Beef Rap.


Track listing
(Note: The 2007 vinyl edition was mastered with tracks 3 and 4 switched (with an unusually long silence after track 2), meaning One Beer ends Side 1 and Potholderz starts Side 2, even though the jacket and center labels are printed with the correct track listing.)
