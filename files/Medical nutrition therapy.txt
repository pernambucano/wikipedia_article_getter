Medical nutrition therapy
Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a therapeutic approach to treating medical conditions and their associated symptoms via the use of a specifically tailored diet devised and monitored by a registered dietitian or professional nutritionist. The diet is based upon the patient's medical and psychosocial history, physical examination, functional examination and dietary history.
The role of MNT when administered by a dietitian or professional nutritionist is to reduce the risk of developing complications in pre-existing conditions such as diabetes as well as ameliorate the effects any existing conditions such as high cholesterol.
Many medical conditions either develop or are made worse by an improper or unhealthy diet.
An example is Intradialytic Parenteral Nutrition (IDPN) Therapy, a nutritional support therapy for people on hemodialysis who have a difficult time maintaining adequate nutrition.
