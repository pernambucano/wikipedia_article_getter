Automated restaurant
Automated restaurant or robotic restaurant is a restaurant that uses robots to do tasks such as delivering food and drinks to the tables and/or to cook the food.


Technology
Restaurant automation means the use of restaurant management system to automate the major operations of a restaurant establishment. Even in the early 1970s, a number of restaurants served foods solely through vending machines. Called automats, or in Japan shokkenki, customers ordered their foods directly through the machines.
More recently, restaurants are opening that have completely or partially automated their services. These may include taking of orders, preparing of food, serving and billing. A few fully automated restaurants operate without any human intervention whatsoever. Robots are designed to help and sometimes replace human labour (such as waiters and chefs). Automation of restaurants also allows the option for greater customization of an order.

Examples include Fritz's Railroad Restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri, VÃ½topna (Railway Restaurant), a franchise of various retaurants and cofeehouses in Czech Republic, 's Baggers Restaurant in Nuremberg, Germany, FuA-Men Restaurant, a ramen restaurant located in Nagoya, Japan, Hajime Robot Restaurant, a Japanese restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand, the Dalu Robot Restaurant in Jinan, China Haohai Robot Restaurant in Harbin, China and Robot Kitchen Restaurant in Hong Kong.
