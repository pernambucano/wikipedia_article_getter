Cook Out is a privately owned fast food restaurant chain in Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Maryland. Founded in Greensboro, North Carolina, the chain has since expanded and now has drive-thru restaurants in over one hundred cities. Most locations consist of a double drive-thru and outdoor seating. The chain itself has grown in size with many locations now spread throughout Virginia.
Cook Out was created by Morris Reaves. He is currently the owner of the company, with his son Jeremy Reaves serving as CEO. As of August 2015 there are 170 locations.
The restaurant specializes in grilled hamburgers and hot dogs, chicken sandwiches, North Carolina barbecue, and milkshakes.
The company opened its first out-of-state store in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on July 30, 2010. Cook Out opened in Clemson and Orangeburg, South Carolina, in 2010. Plans are in the works for more expansion in South Carolina and Virginia. At the very end of 2011, Cook Out opened restaurants in Columbia, South Carolina; Blacksburg, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia. In March 2012, Cook Out opened its first location in Lynchburg, Virginia, and shortly thereafter in Harrisonburg, Virginia. 2013 saw new Cook Out locations in Georgia, and in 2014, there are plans to launch several more Georgia Cook Out locations.
