Lund Food Holdings
Lunds & Byerlys are upscale supermarkets in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area of Minnesota. They are owned and operated by Lund Food Holdings, Inc. As of 2015, there are 27 locations in the Twin Cities area. Its services include PrairieStone Pharmacy, Caribou Coffee, White Way Cleaners, and Bachman's Florist.
Lunds and Byerly's were competing companies until 1997 when Lunds acquired Byerly's. They continued to operate under their individual names until April 2015, when the stores were rebranded Lunds & Byerlys. In 2006, they launched its online grocery shopping service. Shoppers have the option of either picking up their groceries at certain stores or having it delivered to their home. The newest store opened in downtown St. Paul in May 2014.

Lunds was founded as Hove's in the early twentieth century at the corner of Lake Street and Hennepin Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis. Russell Lund, Sr., an employee, took an equity stake in the cheese and cracker department in 1922 and after founding a popcorn business, a larger stake in 1939. The chain took the Lunds name in 1964.

Byerly's

The company was founded in 1968 by Don Byerly, who opened the first store in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Byerly's has since opened twelve other stores in and around the metro area.
Byerly's stores, which range in size from 50,000 to 90,000 square feet (8,400 m2), were previously open 24 hours a day. Store hours changed in February 2008 and are now open 6am to 12am. Byerly's locations also offer in-store United States Post Offices, full-service banks, pharmacies, coffee shops, floral departments, and wines & spirits shops. The Saint Paul Byerly's restaurant location has closed due to the lack of customers.
The store is known for its "great customer service" and its deli and bakery. Byerly's is commonly viewed as high-end grocery shopping, and prices are therefore relatively similar to other retail stores selling the same brands. Product quality however is the core focus of Lunds & Byerlys and the prices reflect higher quality products.
In April 1997, the company was purchased by Lund Food Holdings, Inc., parent company of Edina-based Lunds.
