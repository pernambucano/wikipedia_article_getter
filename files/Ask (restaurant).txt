Ask (restaurant)
ASK, also known as ASK Italian is a British casual dining restaurant chain that serves Italian cuisine in 120 locations in the UK.
The chain, founded by brothers Adam and Samuel Kaye in 1993, and floated on AIM in 1995, was the subject of a public-to-private deal in 2004, after which it was merged with Pizza Express  to form Gondola Holdings, which was later part of the Gondola Group, and was acquired along with Zizzi for £250 million by Bridgepoint Capital in February 2015.
The name can be construed either as the founders' initials or as an abbreviation of "Authentic Sicilian Kitchen". Ask was the chain's original name, it was rebranded as Ask Italian from 2010.


Charity fundraising
In early 2013 ASK switched on Pennies, the digital charity box in all their restaurants, giving their customers the option to top up their bill by 25p and donate to charity Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.
