The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal in the field of clinical nutrition. According to the Journal Citation Reports, it has a 2009 impact factor of 6.307, ranking it third among 66 journals in the category "Nutrition & Dietetics".
The journal was established in 1952 as the Journal of Clinical Nutrition, edited by S.O. Waife and published by the Nutrition Press. It was continued in series under the present title from 1954. It is now published by the American Society for Nutrition. As of June 2009, the journal's editor-in-chief is Dennis M. Bier (Baylor College of Medicine). Since 1961, it has been the official journal of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.
In issue 3 the journal's first guest editorial was written by the cardiologist William Dock, entitled "The reluctance of physicians to admit that chronic disease may be due to faulty diet". In it, he predicted "Since two centuries of practical and experimental study have failed to convince some physicians that diets of salt pork, beans, and flour may be inadequate for maintaining health, it probably will take a long time to convince the profession that diets rich in eggs, hutter, and cream cause the disease which now kills nearly one out of every three physicians."
A poll conducted in 2009 by the Biomedical and Life Sciences Division of the Special Libraries Association identified the journal as among the "100 most influential journals ... over the last 100 years" in the fields of biology and medicine.
